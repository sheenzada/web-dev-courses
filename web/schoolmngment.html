    <p><i> system forms the backbone of every nation. And hence it is important to provide a strong educational foundation to the young generation to ensure the development of open-minded global citizens securing the future for everyone. School Management System consists of tasks such as registering students, attendance record keeping controlling absentees, report cards, timetable and different reports for teachers and parents. The appearance of your student records says a lot about the quality of your school.
 </i></p><h1>Existing System 
</h1><p><i>In the current system we need to keep a number of records related to the student and want to enter the details of the student and the marks manually. In this system only the teacher or the school authority views the mark of the student and they want to enter the details of the student. This is time consuming and has much cost. Teachers may want to associate a student with his parent or emergency persons for disciplinary measures which need searching of the student’s record in the record office. It has been difficult to search a record from thousands of such records and observed that students can take any person claiming that he/she is their parent or emergency person which creates problem in control of students.
</i></p><h1>Purpose 
</h1><p><i>The purpose of any new technology is to make people life easier. This project is database used to manage the school and allows the administrators to register the daily required information of Students, Teachers & office staff.
